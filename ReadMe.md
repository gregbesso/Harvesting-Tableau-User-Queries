## Synopsis

This project came to exist when someone asked me to find out what queries users were creating in Tableau so they can review them and possibly reuse them in other systems. It's my first try at getting 
this accomplished, and my improve over time or be wiped if I find out it isn't the best way to get it done :P

## Code Example

You'll have to check out my blog post, it's the only time I used this and it's the only documentation or example I have of this type of
setup. That is up at: https://gregbesso.wordpress.com/tableau/harvesting-tableau-user-queries/

## Motivation

See Synopsis, that was my motivation described there. I wanted to reuse some existing project that I knew would make publishing this data easier.


## Installation

This project is just the PowerShell that gets the data out from Tableau into XML. You'd need to check out my PSMANAGE project to do the upload to 
SharePoint (or use your own preferred method of sharing the information)
